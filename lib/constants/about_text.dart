ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ä°rem!  

My passion for the mobile world started while studying computer engineering at Tokat GaziosmanpaÅŸa University.
In my final year, i joined the Google Game and App Academy as a scholarship student, where i received training in Flutter mobile development.
With the skills i gained, i started developing my own projects. 
At the end of the academy, my team and i created Ternai, a travel planning app that ranked in the top 7 out of 100 teams!  
Now, iâ€™m continuously improving myself by developing mobile applications, and iâ€™ve also started learning React Native.
I believe that coding is not just a tool but also a way to tell stories. 
I love creating user-friendly, functional, and visually appealing apps!
